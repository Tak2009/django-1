    <h1>Welcome to {{ settings.APP_NAME }}</h1>

    I know I am getting old.... Life is beautiful but sometimes harsh...
    I now have too many app icons on my PC Desktop, mobile and everywhere.
    And checking each app for a specific reason is getting really tiring....
    Thus, this website has been created for this utterly selfish purpose; I want everything I need at one place!!
    This web app will be my one-stop web app to keep my daily life running!
    The source code for this Django project is <a href="https://github.com/Tak2009/django-1" target="_blank">here</a>

            <strong>Recipes:</strong> Every year, I need to spend too much time to google specific recipes during the festive season.
            I sometimes can get exactly the same reciepes I referred in the preveous year but sometimes NOT.
            I always try keeping the URLs with high rated reviews for the next year but my "recordkeeping system" does not properly functioning.
            To prevent from spending too much time to recover my important recipe URLs every year,
            the "Recipes" menu will be my centralized recipe book.

            <strong>Cat Monitor:</strong> We used to have mice issues in our garage. Thus I built an auto motion detection night vision device with
            <a href="https://github.com/Tak2009/raspi-2-motion-detect-sensor-oauth2-tk" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi and Python</a> to detect mice during night time. Now we have a cat and all the issues are gone!!
            Thus, I have decided to use the device not only to monitor the cat but also keep the photo records as her own "blog posts".
            She is a lovely cat but we do not know what she is doing during night time. Once a motion is detected by the device,
            the device send the pic (as a hard evidence!) to the web server via HTTP POST request and the Cat Monitor menu can show whatever she does, her secret night life!!
